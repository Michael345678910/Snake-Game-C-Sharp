# Snake-Game-C-Sharp
This code is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C#. The code starts by setting up the console window size and initializing some variables such as the score, game speed, and food counter. It also initializes the snake's position and length, as well as the initial food position. The game loop runs until the game is over. Inside the loop, it checks if a key is pressed and updates the direction of the snake accordingly. It then moves the snake based on the current direction. After moving the snake, it checks if the snake hits the wall or itself, which would end the game. It also checks if the snake eats the food, in which case it increases the score, generates a new food position, increases the snake's length, and adjusts the game speed. The console is cleared, and the game border, snake, and food are drawn on the console. The score and game speed are displayed at the bottom of the console. The game is slowed down using the Thread.Sleep() method. Once the game is over, a game over screen is displayed with the final score. The player is prompted to press any key to exit the game. The code also includes several helper methods. The MoveSnake() method updates the snake's position based on the current direction. The DrawBorder() method draws the game border. The DrawSnake() method draws the snake on the console. The DrawFood() method draws the food on the console. The DisplayScore() and DisplayGameSpeed() methods display the score and game speed at the bottom of the console, respectively.
